    <p>Easy Hummus!
        Better Than Store Bought
        <b>SERIOUSLY</b>
        try it
        <br><br> <b>YOU WILL NEED:</b>
        <br><br>
        <sup>1 (15oz)</sup> can chickpeas or <sup>1 ½ cups </sup>(250g) cooked chickpeas
        <sup>1/4 cup</sup> (60ml) fresh lemon juice, <sup>1</sup> large lemon
        <sup>1/4 cup</sup> (60ml) well-stirred tahini
        <sup>1</sup> small garlic clove, minced
        <hr>

        <sup>2</sup> tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
        <sup>1/2 teaspoon</sup> ground cumin
        Salt to taste
        <sup>2 to 3 tablespoons</sup> (45ml) cold water
        Dash ground paprika, sumac, or Za’atar for serving
        <br><br> <b>DIRECTIONS:</b>
        <hr>
        <b>1.</b> In the bowl of a food processor, <sub>combine</sub> the tahini and lemon juice and process for <sup>1 minute.</sup> <sub>Scrape</sub> the sides and bottom of the bowl, then process for <sup>30 seconds</sup> more. This extra time helps “whip” or “cream” the tahini, making the hummus smooth <hr> and creamy.
        
        <b>2.</b> <sub>Add</sub> the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and a <sup>1/2 teaspoon</sup> of salt to the whipped tahini and lemon juice. <sub>Process</sub> for <sup>30 seconds</sup>, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, and then <sub>process</sub> for another <sup>30 seconds</sup> or until well blended.
        
        <b>3.</b> <hr> <sub>Add</sub> half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for <sup>1 minute.</sup> <sub>Scrape</sub> the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add the remaining chickpeas and process them until thick and relatively smooth, <sup>1 to 2 minutes.</sup>
        
        <b>4.</b> The hummus will likely be too <hr> thick and still have tiny bits of chickpea. To fix this, slowly <sub>add</sub> <sup>2 to 3 tablespoons</sup> of cold water or aquafaba with the food processor turned on until you reach the perfect consistency.
        
        <b>5.</b> <sub>Taste</sub> and <sub>adjust</sub> as needed. <sub>Serve</sub> hummus with a drizzle of olive <hr> oil and a sprinkle of paprika, sumac, or Za’atar.
        
        <b>6.</b> <sub>Store</sub> homemade hummus in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to <sup>one week</sup>. <sub>Freeze</sub>, <sub>covered</sub> with a thin layer of olive oil, for up to <sup>one month.</sup> <hr>
