  <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
  <p>1. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the <b>tahini</b> and <b>lemon juice</b> and process for <b>1 minute</b>. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then process for 30 seconds more. This extra time helps “whip” or “cream” the tahini, making the hummus smooth and creamy.</p>
  <p>2. Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and a <b>1/2 teaspoon</b> of salt to the whipped tahini and lemon juice. Process for <b>30 seconds,</b> scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, and then process for another <b>30 seconds</b> or until well blended.</p>
  <p>3. Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for <b>1 minute.</b> Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add the remaining chickpeas and process them until thick and relatively smooth, <b>1 to 2 minutes.</b></p>
  <p>4. The hummus will likely be too thick and still have tiny bits of chickpea. To fix this, slowly add <b>2 to 3 tablespoons</b> of cold water or aquafaba with the food processor turned on until you reach the perfect consistency.</p>
  <p>5. Taste and adjust as needed. Serve hummus with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of paprika, sumac, or Za’atar.</p>
  <p>6. Store homemade hummus in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to one week. Freeze, covered with a thin layer of olive oil, for up to <b>one month.</b></p>
